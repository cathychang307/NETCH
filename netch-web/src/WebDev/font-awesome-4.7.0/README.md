Use the Official Font Awesome SASS Ruby Gem to easily get Font Awesome SASS into a Rails or Compass project. Generously maintained by @supercodepoet.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
gem 'font-awesome-sass'
And then execute:
$ bundle
Or install it yourself as:
$ gem install font-awesome-sass
If you use Rails, add this to your e.g. application.scss:

@import "font-awesome-sprockets";
@import "font-awesome";
